# 🌸 Decision Tree Classification on the Iris Dataset

## 📚 Project Overview

This project features a Decision Tree classifier designed to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their characteristics. The Iris dataset is a classic in machine learning, comprising 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is divided into three species classes of Iris flowers.

## 🔧 Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and several libraries. Make sure to install the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `graphviz`

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Navigate to the repository folder.**

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test the model:**

   - For Jupyter Notebook: `Decision Tree.ipynb`
   - For Python script: `decision_tree_iris.py`

## 🗂 Dataset

The Iris dataset used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes:

- Sepal length 🌱
- Sepal width 📏
- Petal length 🌷
- Petal width 📐
- Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) 🌸

## 🤖 Model

We use a Decision Tree classifier from `scikit-learn`. This model is chosen for its straightforwardness and interpretability. It is trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%.

## 📊 Results

The Decision Tree classifier achieved an accuracy of about 97% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying Iris flower species.

## 🔍 Visualization

The Decision Tree is visualized using Graphviz, providing a clear graphical representation of the decision rules and structure of the model.
